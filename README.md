                                                      AIDL & NDK Examples

AIDL, which stands for Android Interface Definition Language, is a language used in Android for defining interfaces that enable inter-process communication (IPC). In the context of Java, AIDL facilitates communication between different components of an Android application, or even between different applications, when they are running in separate processes.
Here's how AIDL relates to Java in Android development:

Define the remote interface using a .aidl file. This file declares the methods that a remote service will offer and the data types that can be passed as parameters or returned as values.
Code Generation:
The Android build system uses the AIDL compiler to generate a Java interface and corresponding stub and proxy classes based on your .aidl file.

Stub Class: This abstract class provides the server-side implementation of the interface. The service developer extends this stub and implements the methods defined in the AIDL interface.

Proxy Class: This class is used by the client to interact with the remote service. It handles the marshalling and unmarshalling of data across process boundaries.
